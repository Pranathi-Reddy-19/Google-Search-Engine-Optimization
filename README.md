ReRank: A Feedback-Driven Browser Overlay for Smarter Search

Search results are dominated by SEO, ads, and outdated resources.Users (especially students) waste time sifting through irrelevant content.B.Tech students searching for notes (e.g., BEEE Unit 1) face SEO junk, outdated PDFs, irrelevant blogs.

A browser plugin that: Detects any domain-specific queries (education, health, coding help, job prep, etc.) Shows an overlay with community-ranked results. Uses explicit ratings (👍👎) + implicit feedback (clicks, dwell). Learns over time → better rankings for future users.

“We re-rank results using student feedback + behavior instead of SEO.”
